	As you can see, my village has come under heavy attack, so we need you to stop those wicked lowlives. I'm in no state to fight, but I know you'll manage without me.
	I doubt you'll have problems with the lowlives. Try to kill all those who stand in your way, we don't need their filth in our lands.
	
	I wish I had something better to reward you with, but what I have ain't too bad either. Blessed journey champion, may you return swiftly and in one piece.",
