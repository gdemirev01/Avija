  text: Excuse me, adventurer. Would you lend me your aid.  The time to strike is
    now, but we're low on manpower, so I need you to join us. If we don't strike now,
    we'll never get rid of them. Join us and fight those terrible miscreants. If you
    don't mind, I'd like to come along. It's your choice though. Please, take care
    of those miscreants. Try to take down as many of them as possible, the less of
    a threat they pose the better.  I wish I could pay you far more than I can, but
    what I can pay isn't less than what's fair either. Good luck hero, not that you
    need it, but a little extra won't hurt.
